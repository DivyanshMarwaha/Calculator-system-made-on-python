# Calculator system made on python

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a simple yet functional calculator system using Python. This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as an introductory project for those learning Python, providing hands-on experience with fundamental programming concepts and command-line interface design.

## Key objectives include:
- **Implementing Core Arithmetic Functions**: Develop functions to handle basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Ensure that the calculator performs these operations accurately and efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values and division by zero. The system should provide clear and informative error messages to guide users.
- **User Interface**: Create a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with the calculator. The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, providing prompts and instructions for selecting operations and entering numbers.
- **Extensibility**: Design the calculator with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of advanced features in the future. Potential enhancements could include square root calculations, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.

This project not only helps users grasp the basics of Python programming but also offers a practical example of how to build and test a command-line application. It is an excellent stepping stone for those interested in further exploring programming and software development.
